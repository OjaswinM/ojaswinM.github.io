    This was my final project for Taskcluster before I got busy with school work. Coincidentally, it was also my biggest contribution yet involving more than 1500 modified lines, 4 PRs and 100s of comments worth discussion and constructive criticism. This whole project took me well around a month to implement and the folks over at Taskcluster were nice enough to guide me throughout.
As mentioned in my previous posts, Taskcluster is used for continuous integration and task execution.  <a href="/post/third/">Read More...</a>

    After I had a few of my PRs merged and was feeling confident about the codebase, I moved on to a bigger project.

Whenever a task needs to be performed its specification is published onto the queue where workers pick up the relevant tasks.  <a href="/post/second/">Read More...</a>

    I had newly learned javascript including NodeJs and Angular and decided to start contributing to open source, mostly because I was curious to see how actual large scale projects were implemented. After lots of searching around I found Taskcluster, which is a continuous intergration and deployment framework developed and maintained by Mozilla. They maintained a list of good first bugs that beginners like me could work on and were very welcoming.  <a href="/post/first/">Read More...</a>
